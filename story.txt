KLIMAANLAGE! That's what my mom used to say everytime I showed her my report card. "BMW biergarten audi schloss," she told me in front of all
my friends waiving around my 4.0 GPA. I turn to them with a smug look,"she said 'I have never been prouder"."  "Vee must celebrate!  Tonight
vee vill habt ein Bratwurst for dinner" she cried in her heavy German accent she got whenever too excited. That night we went to the fanciest
restaurant in town, The Ratskeller Dirndel Lederhose, where my mom ordered her most favorite German meal, the wet- tbewerbsfaehig; and what
do you know, I turn to my right and see Dr. Mehlhase eating it too!  The aptly named  "wettbewerbsfaehig" is an enourmous meal, generally
consumed by people at festivals in eating competitions due to, in Grossvater's words: "that plate is the size of Flughafen Berlin!"
After dinner, I took my mom home and drove my Audi A4 towards Raesfeld to buy the best Gebaeck and while driving saw 4 people in a BWM
wearing the same clothes driving next to me and I knew that they were Dr. Mehlhase's code police and that they know about the bad quality
code that I pushed to the main branch! My hunds immediately started barking rabidly at the code police, and would have bitten their
lederhosen if not for the separation between the cars. Oh Brot my Brot, wherefore art thou Brot? Dost thou hail from thine Biergarten in
Rammestein? Perhaps we could go there together whilst wearing our Dirndel. I fed the hunds a brot as they were hungry.
The hunds weren't sure where the brot was from so I had to tell them it was from the baeckerei.
